# üõÅ 42 Baignoire

Welcome to Baignoire 42, aka Banheira 42! This repository is my self-taught parody of the famous "Piscine" from Escola 42. Here, I will document my journey exploring the C language and computer science fundamentals. This is my unofficial, more relaxed, and adapted way of learning and practicing the teachings of the Piscine using public materials and challenges from Escola 42 that I found in other repositories on GitHub. Although I am not an official student of 42, I believe in the power of collaborative and self-taught learning, just like the school itself.

### The School

The first time I heard about the school was in a video with Akita. After that, I ended up watching some podcasts from [Fora de Norma](https://www.youtube.com/@ForadaNormaPodcast). I think it might be good for you to also get to know a bit more about the project. Since I am not a student, I can't say exactly how things work there, but it caught my attention nonetheless.

What really caught my attention about the school is the proposal of autonomy combined with an asynchronous formation very much focused on practice. That is, from what I understood, they propose real problems and give you the tools to run after the solution. It is like an inversion of the order we usually find in methodologies out there, and for me, who likes to study and learn alone, this was very appealing.

### Rules and Norms...

With some military references, I believe they highly value discipline in various aspects. They have a [rules document](42_nrom.en.pdf) and a [manual](42_manual.en.pdf) that explains not only the technical part but also the behavioral, philosophical, and mental parts. Read and review it carefully before diving into the technical part.

Speaking of norms, they have the [Norminette](https://github.com/42School/norminette), which I consider almost like a linter, and there is also a whole pedagogical reasoning behind these rules. At first, I found it a bit strange, but as I study, I am getting used to it and sometimes even miss it when I see a code that does not follow the standard. Review the document and the repository carefully.

### What is the Order of Topics?

From what I understood, the original Piscine starts with Shell and then follows the sequence in C. Throughout the journey, there are 3 or 4 test batteries (exams) as you advance in the track, in addition to the practical exercises of each module and the group projects (rush). PS: I might be wrong about the nomenclature, but from what I understood, it would be something like that.

In the Shell modules, you become familiar with the terminal and its resources, and in C, it is self-explanatory, entering the study of the language. What I noticed is that the exercises have an ascending degree of difficulty, and in the last tasks, they often mix the technical part you learned with logic and other topics. So, do not stress if you find the final exercises of each module difficult.

### How to Learn Without Classes?

As stated in the instructions, Google is your best friend, and currently, AI chatbots too. Here I will share how I do it and how it works for me. I combine a lot with video lessons on YouTube. Since I understand English well, I look for a lesson or set of lessons from a channel that I like and go for it. One important point: I don't just watch lessons randomly; I watch about the proposed theme in that module.

Moreover, I learned from them to use the `man` command in the terminal much more. It is much more useful than it seems, especially for quick consultations and if you are willing to get lost in the vortex of stacks or Google searches.

#### To Use or Not to Use ChatGPT?

I think like any tool, if you use it the right way, it can be very useful. Just as it can "spit out" the answer to the exercise for you, it can also help you explain topics you didn't understand, propose extra challenges at the difficulty level you need. Anyway, I'm not going to teach you how to use AI, but avoid getting the ready answer. You are already studying alone and have no direct pressure - unless you are there - so there is no reason to deceive yourself here either.

Use it wisely, don't stick to just one. I use Gemini, ChatGPT, Claude, GitHub Copilot, and often put one to confront the other - it's funny when they diverge on some point ;D

Anyway, use it, but use it wisely. The goal is to learn and not generate the answer, especially since there are a lot of ready-made answer keys out there, you don't even need to spend your tokens.

### About Me

üëã My name is Jo√£o Oliveira or JK, whichever you prefer. I am (also) studying part of the Open Source Society University [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science) track. I want to build a strong foundation and solve practical challenges along the way.
