# 🛁 42 Baignoire

Welcome to Baignoire 42! This repository is my self-taught parody of the famous "Piscine" from Escola 42. Here, I will document my journey exploring the C language and computer science fundamentals.

### The Project

Baignoire 42 is my unofficial, more relaxed, and adapted way of learning and practicing the Piscine teachings using the public materials and challenges from Escola 42 that I found in various repositories. Although I am not an official student of 42, I believe in the power of collaborative and self-taught learning, just like the school itself.

### Goals

- 📚 Develop a solid understanding of C.
- 🧠 Strengthen the foundation in algorithms and data structures.
- 📝 Document all progress and learning.
- 🌍 Share knowledge and collaborate with other programming enthusiasts.

### About Me

👋 Hi! I am João Oliveira, also known as JK. I am studying Computer Science through the Open Source Society University [OSSU](https://github.com/ossu/computer-science). I aim to build a strong programming foundation and solve challenges along the way.
